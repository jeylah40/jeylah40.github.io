            <h2>We're Different</h2>
            <p>Karaoke 150, History of Beer 225, Theoretical Physical Education 300. These are just a few examples of the wide variety of courses provided at South Harmon. These kinds of courses provide students with a relaxed environment where they can practice leadership skills teaching a subject that they are very familiar with.
            At the same time, others are able to learn about a more obscure topic that they might not have had a whole lot of knowledge of prior.</p>
